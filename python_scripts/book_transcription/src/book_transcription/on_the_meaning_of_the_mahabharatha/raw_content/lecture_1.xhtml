<h2>THE MAHĀBHĀRATA AND ITS CRITICS</h2>

<p><em>Durvijñeyam ataḥ sarvair<br />
    Bhāratam tu surair api.</em><br />
  — Ānandagīrtha, Mbh. T. N. 2.149</p>

<p>"The Mahābhārata," wrote Hermann Oldenberg, "began its existence as a simple epic narrative. It became, in course of
  centuries, the most monstrous chaos."</p>

<p>A forceful and imaginative writer, Oldenberg has drawn for us a vivid pen-picture of this chaotic epic or epic chaos,
  as it appeared to him, which is worth quoting in extenso as a piece of fine rhetoric:</p>

<blockquote>
  " Neben der Haupterzählung gab es dort wahre Urwälder<br />
  kleinerer Erzählungen, dazu zahllose und endlose Belehrungen<br />
  über Theologisches, Philosophisches, Naturwissenschaftliches,<br />
  Recht, Politik, Lebensweisheit und Lebensklugheit. Ein<br />
  Gedicht voll tiefsinnigen Träumens und Ahnens, zarter Poesie,<br />
  schulmeisterlicher Plattheit — voll von funkelndem Farbenspiel,<br />
  erdrückenden, sich zerdrückenden Massen von Bildern, vom<br />
  Pfeilregen endloser Kämpfe, Gewimmel über Gewimmel todes-<br />
  verachtender Helden, übertugendlicher Mustermenschen, be-<br />
  rückend schöner Frauen, jähzorniger Asketen, abenteuerlicher<br />
  Fabelwesen, toller Mirakel — von leerem Wortschwall und<br />
  von weiten, freien Blicken in die Ordnungen des Weltlaufes." <br />
</blockquote>
<p>This quizzical verdict of the great German Indologist — a veritable prodigy of industry and erudition — appears
  indeed to be justified. Our poem, though commonly called the Great Epic of India, does not fulfil very completely
  Matthew ARNOLD's postulate that "the subject of the epic poem must be some one great complex action." There are indeed
  noticeable, winding in and out of the capacious and multitudinous folds of this prodigious and remarkable tapestry,
  unmistakable traces of some great and complex action. But on account of the mass of legends and disquisitions in which
  the main theme lies embedded, it is difficult to make out even the main outlines of the story underlying the action.
  "Swollen by these inventions," as one sympathetic critic of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> touchingly protests, "the
  portentous volumes are enough to damp the spirit of the most ardent who, starting off gaily upon their journey, are
  soon faced by the deserts of Levitical doctrine and the morasses of primitive speculation, interesting only to the
  antiquarian." Owing to these digressions, which seem to have grown like a malignant parasite on the original heroic
  story and which do in a sense hamper the free movement of the great drama, the poem appears not only to lose in
  artistic value but to be even lacking in bare unity.</p>
<p>Even such an ardent and passionate admirer of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> as Romesh Chunder DUTT felt constrained to
  admit this defect in the poem, and bemoan most eloquently the loss of the original primitive epic. He has told us how
  he pictured to himself the lamentable process of this progressive deterioration. "The epic," he wrote (1898), "became
  so popular that it went on growing with the growth of centuries. Every generation of poets had something to add; every
  distant nation in Northern India was anxious to interpolate some account of its deeds in the old record of the
  international war; every preacher of a new creed desired to have in the old Epic some sanction for the new truths he
  inculcated. Passages from legal and moral codes were incorporated in the work which appealed to the nation much more
  effectively than dry codes; and rules about the different castes and about the different stages of the human life were
  included for the same purpose. All the floating mass of tales, traditions, legends, and myths.... found a shelter
  under the expanding wings of this wonderful
  Epic; and as Krishna worship became the prevailing religion of India after the decay of Buddhism, the old Epic caught
  the complexion of the times, and Krishna-cult is its dominating religious idea in its present shape. It is thus that
  the
  work went on growing for a thousand years after it was first compiled and put together in the form of an Epic; until
  the
  crystal rill of the Epic itself was all but lost in an unending morass of religious and didactic episodes, legends,
  tales and traditions."</p>

<p>He was however by no means utterly pessimistic. For he subsequently adds that "although the old Epic has thus been
  spoilt by unlimited expansion, yet nevertheless the leading incidents and characters of the real Epic are still
  discernible, uninjured by the mass of foreign substance in which they are embedded — even like those immortal marble
  figures which have been recovered from the ruins of an ancient world, and now beautify the museums of modern Europe."
</p>

<p>In that last sentence we have the key-note of Dutt's ideology. Dutt, evidently fascinated by the artistic products of
  Classical Greece, with its well-modelled and astonishingly beautiful specimens of plastic art and the form-perfect
  creations of the epic Muse, was unconsciously applying Greek standards to an Indian composition — at best a hazardous
  procedure — not realizing the essential difference between the Indian and the Greek ideals. With the Greeks the
  dominant passion was the conscious quest of ideal beauty: with the Indians it has invariably been the quest of ideal
  life.</p>

<p>Dutt's violent distaste for the didactic and episodical portions of the poem, which he regarded as encumbrances, led
  him to condense our great epic. In the now famous and deservedly popular rendering of the <em>Mahābhārata</em>
  prepared by him in 1898, he has given a full and unabridged translation into English verse of the main and striking
  incidents of the epic, these pieces being linked together by short connecting notes, which together present the story
  to the modern reader "in a form and within limits which might be acceptable." In this
  way Dutt has tried apologetically to insinuate the fertilizing waters of the tempestuous torrent of our national epic
  poetry, by means of a neat little modern concrete canal, into the stream of world literature.</p>

<p><strong>OLDENBERG</strong> had always contended that the "original" of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> was composed of short
  poetical pieces joined together by connecting links in prose. It is not unlikely that Romesh Dutt, starting with a
  similar idea, had imagined that in his English rendering of our poem he had arrived at the form of the epic as it was
  originally put together, some centuries before the Christian era, before it was "spoilt" by moralizing and sectarian
  Brahmin interpolators.</p>

<p>If Romesh Dutt, a thoroughbred "native" of India with just a thin veneer of Western culture, had after a life-long
  study of the epic failed to grasp the real significance of what he elsewhere describes as "the greatest work of
  imagination that Asia has produced" — he might even have said, with some justification, that the world has produced —
  there is nothing strange in the circumstance that most of the Western critics have likewise failed to do so. They have
  uniformly felt and exhibited a characteristic uneasiness — I may even say helplessness — when faced with the — to
  them, unnatural — phenomenon of an avowedly narrative poem in which the "moral", so to say, is nearly four times as
  long as the story itself. Their researches have, consequently, revolved almost invariably round the idea of finding
  criteria for distinguishing between the "early" and the "late" portions of the epic, between the original and the
  interpolation, criteria for cutting away what they naturally regard as the asphyxiating parasite and exposing the old
  primitive saga in its pristine purity and glory.</p>

<p>This definitive direction seems to have been given to Western studies in connection with the <em>Mahābhārata</em>
  almost from the beginning. Franz Bopp, the Father of Indo-germanic Philology, (who was also the first in modern times
  to edit from manuscripts selected episodes from the <em>Mahābhārata</em> and make them available in a printed form,)
  had expressed his opinion as early as 1829 — now more than a century ago —
  that all parts of the epic were not of the same age, — which is in a way no doubt quite true.</p>

<p><strong>BOPP</strong> was closely followed by that encyclopaedic writer <strong>Christian LASSEN</strong>, who was
  the first European scholar to submit the <em>Mahābhārata</em> to a complete analysis and with whom the modern critical
  study of the epic may be said to have begun. As a result of his erudite researches, this versatile scholar, endorsing
  the conclusions of <strong>BOPP</strong>, expressed his conviction that in the <em>Mahābhārata</em> we have pieces
  belonging to very different periods and of very different colour and content. He tried therefore to separate the
  various strata and to date them — a very hazardous venture at any time. His conclusions may be summarized thus. The
  recitation of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> at the sacrifice of Saunaka must be understood to be the second recension of
  the poem. This recension is the one referred to in the <em>Gṛhya Sūtra</em> of Āśvalāyana (3.4.4), whom
  <strong>LASSEN</strong> places — quite hypothetically of course — about 350 B.C. Now as this Āśvalāyana was the direct
  disciple of Saunaka (identified by <strong>LASSEN</strong> without any further proof with the Kulapati Saunaka of the
  epic story), the second recension of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> must have been made about 460 or 400 B.C. Since that
  time, <strong>LASSEN</strong> held, the only additions made to the poem were of a "Krishnite" character. Eliminating
  these, we may accept the work on the whole as a monument of pre-Buddhist India. To us these stratificatory adventures
  and chronological speculations of <strong>LASSEN</strong> appear crude and puerile in the extreme; they were taken
  very seriously by his contemporaries, and regarded as a stupendous advance in their knowledge of the Great Epic of
  India. Owing to his very perfunctory study of this prodigious poem, the learned author of the <em>Indische
    Alterthumskunde</em> had failed to realize that eliminating the "Krishnite" elements from our <em>Mahābhārata</em>
  was a not less serious operation than removing all the vital elements from the body of a living organism; and that
  consequently the residue would no more represent the "original" heroic poem than a mangled cadavre, lacking the vital
  elements, would represent the organism in its origin or infancy.
</p>
<p>Another notable attempt at reconstructing the original epic was made between 1883 and 1894 by the Scandinavian
  scholar Sören Sörensen, to whom we also owe the excellent <em>Index to the Names in the Mahābhārata</em> (London
  1904-1925), a solid contribution to Mahābhārata studies, indispensable to every serious student of the Great Epic. His
  attempts at reconstruction of the epic kernel have unfortunately not proved equally valuable. He starts with the very
  innocuous assumption that in its oldest form the Mahābhārata must have been a saga. That being granted, the unity of
  the main story shows that it was the creation of a single mind: which is also a very reasonable assumption. In the
  original poem, therefore, Sörensen argues, there could be no contradiction, repetition or digression — anything, in
  fact, which would mar its unity and homogeneity. These were some of the leading ideas underlying his reconstruction of
  the Ur-Mahābhārata. Rejecting accordingly from the Vulgate text everything that appeared to him like an episode or a
  didactic digression, he obtained at first an edition of some 27,000 stanzas. But even this extract, he thought,
  included materials belonging to different epochs. He therefore proceeded to deduct from this trituration immense
  blocks of the text which appeared to him to betray their character as interpolations by the fact that they contained a
  mention of persons or things of a modern date. This second attenuation rendered the epic to a concentrated essence of
  some seven or eight thousand stanzas, which seems to have satisfied the soul of Sörensen. Is there not somewhere a
  mention of 8800 ślokas of an enigmatic character, which Vyāsa knew and Suka knew and which Sānjaya may or may not have
  known? The number of stanzas in Sörensen's "Ur-text" is strangely close to the so-called
  "kūtaślokas" mentioned in an oft-cited stanza which is a patent interpolation found in some very
  late Devanagari manuscripts and which has consequently been rejected in the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata. Was
  Sörensen perhaps unconsciously influenced in his computations by this fictitious figure? It is difficult to say.</p>
<p>In any case, Auguste Barth, a keen student of Indian religious literature and withal an impartial and outspoken
  critic, after careful consideration of
  the arguments advanced by SÖRENSEN in support of his thesis, was constrained to pass on it a verdict which may be
  regarded as final: "le méthode de l'auteur, malgré toutes le précautions possible, est arbitraire et ...... le
  problème tel qu'il le pose, est en réalité insoluble." Yes, it may safely be added to the list of insoluble problems.</p>

<p>SÖRENSEN's attempt at establishing the Ur-text of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> stands by itself, and the experiment was,
  as far as I know, never repeated. Instead, European scholars contented themselves with theorizing about the nature and
  the character of the "nucleus" and perfecting their criteria for distinguishing between the "old" and the "new," the
  original and the spurious in the epic text. Special attention, wrote (1896) the Vedic scholar LUDWIG, must be given to
  the way in which the various episodes have been joined together, whether they have been welded into a harmonious whole
  or whether they have been pieced together clumsily. The critic must be on the look-out for "misconceived links,"
  "striking laboriousness," "absolute superfluity," "repetion of the theme," "unnatural and farfetched motivation,"
  "incongruity between the explanation and the matter to be explained," and so on and so forth. These are all sure
  indications of unoriginality and interpolation. The critic <em>must further study</em> closely the metre, language and
  style. <em>A sudden change</em> in any of these is thoroughly suspicious and calls for special inquiry. As a result of
  such a thorough-going examination, we may hope to distinguish confidently the different strata and analyse the poem
  correctly into its components. Notwithstanding the high-sounding phrases in which it is couched, it is easy to see
  that even this critique cannot give absolutely certain and dependable results, it being merely the exploitation of
  individual opinion, which selects what pleases it and rejects, on insufficient evidence, what is incompatible with a
  preconceived subjective scheme.</p>

<p>This atomistic method reaches its culmination in the researches of the great American Indologist E. Washburn HOPKINS,
  who had specialized in the <em>Mahābhārata</em> and who, as a result of an intensive study of the epic extending over
  many years, made the interesting discovery that there was no text there at all. He could see only a nebulous mass of
  incongruities, absurdities, contradictions, anachronisms, accretions and interpolations! "In what shape," asks
  HOPKINS, "has epic poetry (in India) come down to us?" And his own answer is:
<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>A text that is no text</em> (italics mine), enlarged and altered in every recension, chapter after chapter
    recognized even by native commentaries as prakṣipta, in a land without historical sense or care for the preservation
    of popular monuments, where no check was put on any reciter or copyist who might add what beauties or polish what
    parts he would, where it was a merit to add a glory to the pet god, where every popular poem was handled freely and
    is so to this day."</p>
</blockquote></p>

<p>Seeing that despite his categorical denial of the existence of a text, he has on his hands a corpus of some 200,000
  verses, which is about eight times the size of the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em> put together and which the
  Indian people have persisted during the last two thousand years in calling their national epic, HOPKINS moots the
  question when this curious text — which is no text — could have been composed. To this question he could give only a
  cryptic answer, reminding us of the wise pronouncements of the Delphic oracle. The time of the present
  <em>Mahābhārata</em>, writes HOPKINS, was one "when the sixty-four kalās were known, when continuous iambic pādas were
  written, when the latest systems of philosophy were recognized, when the trimūrti was acknowledged, when there were
  one hundred and one Yajur Veda schools, when the sun was called Mihira, when Greek words had become familiar, and the
  Greeks were known as wise men, when the eighteen islands and eighteen Purāṇas were known, when was known the whole
  literature down to grammars, commentaries, Dharmaçāstras, granthas, pustakas, written Vedas, and complete MSS. of the
  Mahābhārata including the Harivañca."
</p>

<p>This rigmarole is just his special way of proving the lack of unity in the epic and its late date. The learned
  labours of HOPKINS ultimately crystallized in the preparation of a complicated table of approximate dates of the work
  in its different stages, which he probably regarded as his greatest contribution
  to the study of the epic and the final solution of the Mahābhārata Problem. Here is the scheme of dates rigged up by
  HOPKINS :</p>

<p>400 B.C. : Bhārata (Kuru) lays, perhaps combined into one, but with no evidence of an epic.</p>

<p>400 to 200 B.C. : A <em>Mahābhārata</em> tale with Pāṇḍu heroes, lays and legends combined by the Puranic
  diaskeuast; Kṛṣṇa as a demigod; no evidence of didactic form or of Kṛṣṇa's divine
  supremacy.
</p>

<p>200 B.C. to 200 A.D. : Remaking of the epic with Kṛṣṇa as all-god, intrusion of masses of didactic matter, addition
  of Puranic material old and new; multiplication of exploits.</p>

<p>200 to 400 A.D. : The last books added with the introduction to the first book, the swollen Anuśāsana separated from
  Śānti and recognized as a separate book; and finally,</p>

<p>400 A.D. + : Occasional amplifications.</p>

<p>Without wishing to detract from the merits of the work done by HOPKINS in other fields, which may have its own value,
  I will say candidly that for all intents and purposes this pretentious table is as good as useless, — as it was indeed
  bound to be. ("All dates," says WHITNEY, "given in Indian literary history are pins set up to be bowled down again."
  This was never more true than in the case of the dates given by HOPKINS, which are in fact, one and all, quite
  hypothetical and perfectly arbitrary.) Indeed there is not one figure or one statement in the above table which can be
  verified or which can lay claims to objective validity.</p>

<p>Let me state here more fully, for the sake of clarity, the view-point of the modern analytical criticism of the
  <em>Mahābhārata</em>. (Modern criticism begins with the assumption that the epic is definitely not the work of any one
  poet, like most works of antiquity. No one can write unaided a poem of 100,000 stanzas. We cannot possibly conceive
  any one man being equal to the task attributed to the supposed author of the epic, Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana Vyāsa. The poem
  is, therefore, unquestionably a compilation, embodying the work of many writers of varying abilities—some of them even real poets—who have added to the original corpus from time to time as
  it pleased them. The result is naturally a confused assemblage of heterogenous matter originating from different hands
  and belonging to different strata. [A careful analysis of the poem from this view-point reveals the fact that in its
  present form at least, the work has a radical defect in so far as it consists fundamentally of two mutually
  incompatible elements, namely, a certain "epic nucleus" and an extensive and undigested mass of didactic-episodical
  matter, elements which are but loosely hinged together and which form moreover an unbalanced combination. The first
  element, the epic nucleus, is naturally the older component and is presumably based on an historical reality, which is
  preserved in a highly distorted and tendentious form but which retains nevertheless certain genuine archaic features
  in fossilized condition such as polyandry and levirate, which latter are of immense interest and importance for the
  study of Indian ethnology and prehistoric antiquity. The nucleus mentioned above was now unfortunately used—or rather
  misused—by wily priests, tedious moralists and dogmatizing lawyers as a convenient peg on which to hang their didactic
  discourses and sacerdotal legends, which have naturally no organic connection with the epic nucleus. This nucleus of
  the epic, a Kṣatriya tale of love and war, does possess a sort of unity, which is lacking entirely in the other
  element, the priestly episodes and the moralizing discourses, which latter by themselves, loosened from their
  moorings, would neatly and automatically fall apart. The epic story is in part at least a fairly well-constructed
  narrative, worthy of our attention, and produces the impression of having been yet more virile—a real "human
  document"—before it was distorted in the process of assimilation with the moralistic pabulum and legal claptrap of a
  grasping and degenerate priesthood. The <em>Mahābhārata</em> is in short a veritable chaos, containing some good and
  much useless matter. It is a great pity that a fine heroic poem, which may even be found to contain precious germs of
  ancient Indian history, should have been thus ruined by its careless custodians. But it is not quite beyond
  redemption. A skilful surgical operation — technically called "Higher Criticism" — could still disentangle the submerged "epic core" from the
  adventitious matter — known to textual critics as "Interpolation" — in which it lies embedded. The
  <em>Mahābhārata</em> Problem thus reduces itself to the discovery of criteria which will enable us to analyse the poem
  and to dissect out the "epic nucleus" from the spurious additions with which it is deeply incrusted. This is the
  "Analytical Theory" of the origin and the character of the <em>Mahābhārata</em>, which was espoused by the majority of
  the Western critics of the Great Epic of India, chief among them being LASSEN, WEBBER, LUDWIG, SÖRENSEN, HOPKINS and
  WINTERNITZ.
</p>

<p>This theory is obviously the outcome of superficial study. The epic at first sight does produce upon a casual
  observer the impression of being a bizarre and meaningless accumulation of heterogeneous elements. This first
  impression, however,—as has been pointed out by HELD—soon makes room for a second, that of astonishment, as one
  realizes that this massive monument of Indian antiquity may undoubtedly lay claim to being more or less flawless from
  the constructional view-point and withal perfectly balanced. This fact appears to have been clearly realized also by
  LUDWIG, himself an ardent advocate of the atomistic theory, who was honest enough to admit the organic unity of this
  stupendous poem. Notwithstanding his preconceptions, which led him to support the analytic theory, he confessed openly
  his inability to explain how, in spite of the extreme complicacies of mechanism, it operated in a manner so precise
  that no crass contradictions were discernible in this prodigious work, there being at most only vague traces here and
  there of what might be regarded as such.</p>

<p>But that is not the end of the story. There is another little odd twist in the poem, we are told : a subtle sort of
  topsy-turvydom underlying the story and vitiating it from beginning to end. The poem has obviously a didactic purpose.
  It sets out clearly to inculcate a moral. Its method is to contrast the life and fate of the righteous Pāṇḍavas and
  the urighteous Kauravas, and to induce people to lead a good and virtuous
  life by demonstrating that, in spite of appearances to the contrary, truth and virtue do triumph in the end (yato
  dharmas tato jayah). This is undoubtedly a very laudable objective. And yet even this simple and clear aim is scarcely
  achieved by the poem. The characters do not consistently act the parts which they are advertised to do. The "heroes"
  of the poem are indeed constantly talking about Dharma, but their actions belie their hollow professions and do not
  conform even to the most elementary standards of common morality. They are not real heroes, with pure white shining
  souls. They give one the impression rather of being "villains," who have been liberally whitewashed by interested
  poets.</p>

<p>Observe how these "righteous" Pāṇḍavas, the supposed souls of Dharma, are able to win the war only by Adharma, by a
  series of frauds or at least by some very shabby and unchivalrous acts, which no right-thinking person would hesitate
  to condemn. For instance, our "hero" Yudhiṣṭhira, the so-called Dharmarāja, when prompted by his less scrupulous
  advisers, yields, in spite of his much advertised righteousness, to the temptation of telling, at a very critical
  stage of the battle, a barefaced lie, knowing full well that his mendacious statement would be believed by his
  opponent and would inevitably bring about the untimely death of his own revered preceptor, to whom he pretends to be
  deeply attached and who — according to theory — has indisputable claims on his unswerving homage and allegiance.</p>

<p>Take another instance. The blustering and boastful Bhīma deals Duryodhana, while engaged in a mortal combat with him,
  an admittedly foul blow, breaking his thighs and incapacitating him, quite against the rules of the game, which his
  chivalrous opponent rigidly observes. This is a very cowardly and barbarous act, which reflects no credit on our hero
  or his advisers, but on the contrary shows them up in their true colours, condemning them in our eyes as treacherous
  hooligans.</p>

<p>And, finally, even the noble and god-like Arjuna, the special friend and protégé of Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is far from
  being an example of the "verray parfitt gentle Knight." He is guilty of killing in cold blood the venerable Bhīṣma,
  the
  grandsire of the Kurus, shooting at him while hiding behind another effeminate warrior with whom the old knight could
  not fight, and thus screening himself, like a coward, from retaliation by his stalwart opponent. Again while fighting
  with the truly noble Karna in a single combat, Arjuna shoots and kills his honourable rival when the latter is at a
  disadvantage and is humbly pleading for time. Vain is the plea of Sri Krsna that Karna, having behaved meanly before,
  had forfeited the right of equitable treatment and could not now appeal for justice or mercy. Two wrongs do not make a
  right. Can we regard these Pandava brothers as models of heroism, chivalry, nobility or righteousness?</p>

<p>The Kauravas on the other hand unquestionably behave more honourably and on the whole more magnanimously. They never
  stoop to employ such base and ignominious tricks on the battlefield against their enemies. They are manly, courageous,
  chivalrous and noble. These great scions of an old aristocratic family could play more worthily the distinguished rôle
  of the heroes of the Indian epopee than the treacherous and sanctimonious Pandavas, who show themselves to have been
  in reality ignoble parvenus and usurpers, glorified by a later generation. The poem itself naively records that at the
  moment of Duryodhana's death, though the ungenerous and brutal Bhima was mean enough to kick and trample on the
  anointed head of the fallen monarch, the gods themselves showered flowers on the defeated hero. And this Duryodhana is
  now the villain of the piece! It is unnecessary to multiply examples.</p>

<p>Here is a paradox. The book gives itself out as a dharma-grantha. With uplifted arms, we are told, Vyasa proclaims
  that Dharma is supreme in this world. But that is a high ideal which even his characters — his own creations — do not
  fulfil!</p>

<p>The above are just a few examples of an inherent contradiction subsisting between the story and the "moral" sought to
  be inculcated in the epic in its present form. The poem does contain explanations condoning the "Sins" of the
  Pandavas. But that is special pleading, sheer casuistry, which fails to carry conviction to any but the most simple-minded of the readers.</p>

<p>The talented discoverer of this set of facts was Adolf HOLTZMANN. It was to explain this element of contradiction in
  the story that he thought out his ingenious theory, which Hopkins later styled the "Inversion Theory" and which found
  many adherents. This criticism, which bases itself on the supposed want of unity in the characters, is an effort to
  prove not merely a change but a complete inversion (in our present story) of the original theme, which explains its
  name "Inversion Theory." "Starting with the two-fold nature of Krishna-Vishnu as man and god," as Hopkins says in
  describing the theory, "and with the glossed-over sins of the Pandus, the critic argues that the first poem was
  written for the glory of the Kurus, and subsequently tampered with to magnify the Pandus; and that in this latter
  from we have our present Epic, dating from before the fourth century B.C." The first poem would thus
  be completely changed, or, as one writer has expressed it "set upon its head."</p>

<p>The indefatigable author of this theory, who had taken immense pains to study the epic from various angles in search
  of arguments to support and fortify his pet thesis, ultimately arrived at the following recondite reconstruction of
  the epic, as summarized by Held: "Right back in the most ancient times there was a guild of court-singers who extolled
  in their professional poetry the mighty deeds of their monarchs. Then came a talented poet who made of the original
  epic, composed in honour of the renowned race of the Kauravas, a poem in praise of a great Buddhist ruler, perhaps
  Aśoka. But now the new teaching, coming into conflict with the growing pretensions of the Brahmins, begins to decline,
  and the priests convert the now popular poem to their own use, but reverse the original purpose of the work as a
  whole. Now it is no longer the Kauravas who are lauded but their very adversaries, the Pāṇḍavas, to whom a decided
  predilection for the Brahmanical doctrine is ascribed. The epic is subjected to further revision. Buddhism is
  eliminated altogether, both Vishnu and Krishna are thrust into the foreground, the Epic is assimilated to the</p>
ancient and sacred chronicles of the Purāṇas and portions of a didactic character are interpolated. And in this revised
and irreconguisably altered recension the Epic was non-existent until the twelfth century A.D."</p>

<p>These wild aberrations of HOLTZMANN, which hardly deserve the name of a theory that is commonly applied to it, have
  now little more than an antiquarian interest. They are, as was pointed out by BARTH, not only at variance with the
  probable course of the religious and literary history of India, but they also stand in crass contradiction with
  positive and dated facts. The latter relation was brought out especially by the quite independent investigations of
  BÜHLER regarding the <em>Mahābhārata</em>, which were more of a factitive character and which clearly showed that
  there were no indications of any important additions having been made to the epic after the eleventh century.
  Furthermore, as BÜHLER showed, already in the eighth century the poem must have had a form not very different from the
  one in which we now possess it, namely, as a <em>Dharmaśāstra</em> or a <em>Smṛti</em> work, that is, a book of sacred
  lore. The epigraphic evidence, moreover, clearly proved that the epic was known as early as the fifth century A.D. as
  a work consisting of 100,000 stanzas and composed by the great Ṛṣi Vyāsa. From this clear and unequivocal evidence,
  BÜHLER drew the important conclusion that the work must unquestionably have been extant in practically the same shape
  as at present, several centuries prior to 400 A.D. This momentous finding of BÜHLER demolished completely the rickety
  chronological framework of HOLTZMANN'S fantastic reconstruction and made it clear that the historical background of
  the thesis was, fundamentally, as unsound as it was absurd.)</p>

<p>HOLTZMANN'S theory found, however, a doughty champion in the Viennese Professor Leopold von SCHROEDER, who by pruning
  away the more patent absurdities set it once more on its legs, and even popularized it through the persuasive quality
  of his felicitous style and suave mannerism. SCHROEDER'S exposition of the original theory appealed to those scholars
  who were impressed by HOLTZMANN'S novel demonstration of an unsuspected element of contradiction in the very plot of
  the epic, but who were not prepared to give their assent to all the fatuous eccentricities of the author of the original
theory. In the new theory Aśoka was banished, and the conflict between Buddhism and Brahmanism was discreetly thrust in
the background. The inversion theme, which was the pivot of the whole theory, was naturally retained and strengthened.

<p>Remodelled by the genial Schroeder, the Inversion Theory took the following shape, as described by Hopkins:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The original poet ... lived at a time when Brahmā was the highest god (700 to 500 or 400 B.C.); and this singer
    was a child of the Kuru-land. He heard reports of the celebrated Kuru race that once reigned in his land, but had
    been destroyed by the dishonourable fighting of a strange race of invaders. This tragic overthrow he depicted in
    such a way as to make his native heroes models of knightly virtue, while he painted the victors (Pāndus, Panchālas,
    Matsyas), with Krishna, hero of the Yādavas, at their head, as ignoble and shamefully victorious. This is the old
    Bhārata song mentioned in Açvalayana. After a time Krishna became a god, and his priests,
    supported by the Pāndus, sought to make Krishna (Vishnu) worthy to be set against Buddha. Their exertions were
    successful. Vishnu in the fourth century became the great god, and his grateful priests rewarded their helpers, the
    Pāndus, by taking the Bhārata poem in hand and making a complete change in the story, so as to relieve them of the
    reproaches of the old poet. Finally they worked it into such shape that it praised the Pāndus and blamed their
    opponents. About this time they inserted all the episodes that glorify Vishnu as the highest god. The Pāndus then
    pretended that they had originally belonged to the Kuru stock, and the cousinship portrayed in the poem was
    invented; whereas they were really an alien, probably a southern race."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This ill-conceived theory, though advocated by Lassen, Winternitz and J. J. Meyer, has been discountenanced, for
  different reasons, by even Barth, Sylvain Lévi, Pischel, Jacobi, Oldenberg, and Hopkins. It has thus been condemned by
  scholars justly eminent in criticism of the epic and in Sanskrit scholarship. The only reason that has been adduced in support of it, as has already been indicated, is the
  alleged justification of the hateful rôle said to have been played by the Pāṇḍavas in the old form of the epic and the
  reproaches heaped upon the Kauravas, the royal heroes of the old poem. The protagonists of this theory want us, in
  other words, to believe that the Pāṇḍavas and their partisans, the priests of Viṣṇu, took a poem that was written to
  defame the Pāṇḍavas and Viṣṇu, and written over again so as to represent them as perfect.</p>

<p>In canvassing our support to the inversion theme, <strong>HOLTZMANN</strong>, like a dextrous juggler, manipulating
  his material in an adroit manner, manages to show us all the time only one side of the shield, never letting us see
  the other side at all. It is indeed true that the Pāṇḍavas make themselves guilty of some slight breaches of
  pugilistic conventions in the course of the long drawn out and bitter war of annihilation fought out on the plains of
  Kurukṣetra. Bhīṣma, Droṇa, Karṇa and Duryodhana were all killed in the war by subterfuges or tricks which violate the
  strict code of chivalrous and knightly combats. But the Kauravas are just as unscrupulous, if not indeed more so; only
  they are discreet and diplomatic in the extreme. Their "sins," as <strong>HOPKINS</strong> has pointed out, smack of
  cultivated wickedness. They secretly try to burn their enemies alive. They seek to waylay and kill the ambassador of
  the Pāṇḍavas. They form a conspiracy and send out ten men under oath (Saṁśaptakas) to attack Arjuna. They slay
  Arjuna's son first in order to weaken Arjuna's heart. Are these dark deeds worthy of models of royal and knightly
  honour? The truth is that the Kauravas are crafty and designing; they are shrewd enough not to break the smaller laws
  of propriety. They plot in secret, hiding their deceitfulness under an ostentatious cloak of justice and benevolence.
  They sin at heart, and present to the world a smiling and virtuous face. The Pāṇḍavas are on the other hand
  represented throughout as being truly ingenuous and guileless. They do "sin": they are human for that. But their
  "sins" are palpably overt and markedly evident. The Kauravas are sanctimonious hypocrites; the wrath and animosity of
  the grossly outraged Pāṇḍavas stare us in the face.</p>
<p>The contrast is well marked and clearly intended. "The sociological data of the epic period," says
  <strong>HOPKINS</strong> in commenting on this aspect of the argument, "show that society had advanced from a period
  when rude manners were justifiable and tricks were considered worthy of a warrior to one when a finer morality had
  begun to temper the crude royal and military spirit. This is sufficient explanation of that historical anomaly found
  in the Great Epic, the endeavour on the part of the priestly redactors to palliate and excuse the sins of their
  heroes." An earlier age, according to <strong>HOPKINS</strong>, allowed what a later condemned. <!-- [UNCLEAR] --> He,
  therefore, concludes that two types of civilization are embalmed in the poem. "Those same priests who framed the
  fighting code," remarks <strong>HOPKINS</strong> in another place, "and endeavoured to implant in the brutal warrior
  kings a moral, not to say a chivalrous sentiment, might have been swayed by two opposing desires in handing down their
  own national epic. They accordingly appear to have retained all the old excesses and barbarities, and expended their
  ingenuity in exonerating their royal patrons, the Pāṇḍavas, by casuistical excuses and facile
  constructions."
</p>

<p><strong>HELD</strong> has rightly rejected this specious explanation of <strong>HOPKINS</strong>, pointing out that
  there is no reason to picture to ourselves those more primitive cultures as a barbarian state of society in which
  "brutal warrior kings" were rampant. There is as a matter of fact no question here at all of the embalming of
  different types of civilization, as imagined by <strong>HOPKINS</strong>. It is very evident that most of the critical
  situations of this epic drama are the result of free invention by the poets inspired by a definite purpose that has
  remained hidden from <strong>HOPKINS</strong> and other critics of his school of thought. <strong>HOPKINS</strong> was
  justified in suspecting that the solution of the Mahābhārata Problem offered by <strong>HOLTZMANN</strong> and
  <strong>SCHROEDER</strong> was unsound, if not 'absolutely perverse'; but the reasons he adduced for the rejection of
  the Inversion Theory are themselves not cogent.
</p>

<p>In laying undue emphasis on the different periods of civilization, <strong>HOPKINS</strong> has entirely missed the
  point of the narrative. The contrast depicted in the poem, as any person gifted with common sense can see, is not the
  fortuitous outcome of the fusion of different epochs of civilization, but is clearly intended by the author or authors of the poem to portray
different aspects of the human personality, to visualize the different types of the subtle psyche of man. The
characterization of the Kauravas especially is obviously designed to clarify by vivid projection the acute contrast
between the "Inner Man" and the "Outer Man." And these two old neighbours are not creatures peculiar to any definite
epoch or any particular country. They are international characters. Nay, they are universal. They have lived side by
side at all times and in all climes. They are as active and potent today as they were in the time of the Mahābhārata and
even before that, in pre-historic times. How the didactic interludes of the poem are woven into the fabric of the tale
and what their raison d'être is will be explained in the sequel. But it would not be inappropriate to point out even at
this stage — though I am anticipating somewhat — that the main interest of the epic is held and centred precisely on the
subtle interplay of personality, on the disparity and conflict between the "Inner Man" and the "Outer Man", in other
words, on happenings hidden from the outside world in the very soul of man. And it is just this factor which gives this
immortal book a lasting value and interest in the eyes of every thoughtful inquirer into the mysteries of life, placing
it on a level with the greatest works of fiction and drama of all times.</p>

<p>The atomistic methods of the advanced critics of the Mahābhārata having proved barren of any useful or intelligent
  result, some attempt was made to understand the poem as a whole. The most notable of these legitimate endeavours was
  that of Joseph DAHLMANN; and as such it deserves special recognition. A certain underlying unity of aim and plan in
  this gigantic work was postulated and dogmatically emphasized by this great Jesuit scholar, who of all the foreign
  critics of the Mahābhārata may be said to approach nearest to any real understanding of the Great Epic of India. He
  propounded a view of the origin and character of the Mahābhārata which HOPKINS dubbed as the "Synthetic Theory." This
  theory categorically repudiates as utterly fantastic the modern notion that the Great Epic is but a haphazard
  compilation of disjointed and incoherent units. It insists on the other hand — as the name of the theory already suggests — that the Mahābhārata
  is primarily a synthesis, a synthesis of all the various aspects of Law, in the widest sense of the term, covered by
  the Indian conception of Dharma, cast by a master intellect into the alluring shape of a story, of an epic. In other
  words, the Mahābhārata is an epic and a law-book (Rechtsbuch) in one. There is thus no question whatsoever of an "epic
  core" that had become gradually incrusted with didactic accretions, an idea which is nothing more than a phantasy,
  just an obsession of the modern critic. The poem is, as Indian tradition has always implied, a conscious product of
  literary art (<em>kāvya</em>) of the highest order, with a pronounced unity of conception, aim, and treatment. It is
  not in any, sense the work of generations of poets, but the work of a single "diaskeuast", who has welded
  various existing elements into a single organic whole and produced an epic that more or less satisfied the
  requirements of a definite structural unity.</p>

<p>It was extremely daring on the part of the author of this theory to formulate and openly advocate a radical
  view-point like this in conscious and determined opposition to the prevailing theories regarding the character and
  origin of the Great Epic of India. He was challenging the almost unanimous verdict of self-styled authorities on the
  subject of the <em>Mahābhārata</em>. Undismayed by the barrage of hostile and even mocking criticism which greeted his
  first work on the subject, <em>Das Mahābhārata als Epos und Rechtsbuch.</em> (1895), he continued his labours,
  defending his favourite thesis again, with great eloquence and enthusiasm, in a second volume, <em>Genesis des
    Mahābhārata</em> (1899), which met with no better reception at the hands of his intolerant and opinionated
  colleagues, who would not be convinced.</p>

<p>In these earnest and thought-provoking books, DAHLMANN has shown, on the basis of well selected and convincing
  examples, that the relation between the narrative and the didactic matter in our epic was definitely not of a casual
  character, but was intentional and purposive, concluding therefrom that it was impossible to separate the two elements
  without destroy-
  ing or mutilating the poem; just as one cannot separate the textile fabric of a tapestry from the picture it depicts
  without defacing and injuring the tapestry. And this demonstration is the most valuable part of the work of
  <strong>DAHLMANN</strong>. The didactic matter of the epic, <strong>DAHLMANN</strong> insisted, was a necessary — nay,
  an essential — element of the poem, of which the fable itself was in fact largely invented just for the purpose of
  illustrating certain well defined maxims of law, certain legal, moral and ethical principles underlying the fabric of
  Indian Society. Thus, for example, there is, according to <strong>DAHLMANN</strong>, in the crucial instance no
  historical basis for the polyandric marriage of Draupadi with the Pāṇḍava brothers, which is to be understood only
  symbolically. The Pāṇḍavas themselves symbolize the undivided or joint family; and Draupadi, their common wife in the
  story, stands for the ideal embodiment and representation of the unconditional unity of the family. A tribal
  confederacy may perhaps have formed the historical basis of the unity of the Pāṇḍavas. Draupadi would then symbolize
  the corporate unity and undivided authority of the confederacy.
</p>

<p>According to <strong>DAHLMANN</strong>, the origin of the epos as a didactic work was founded in the basic character
  of rhapsody, which was the natural guardian and herald of the sacred lore. The rhapsody, then, as the vehicle
  (Trägerin) of sacred lore, became naturally the creator of poesy and of a manual of popular instruction (Lehrbuch) at
  the same time.</p>

<p>We may summarize as follows the main conclusions of <strong>DAHLMANN</strong> with regard to the questions in which
  we are at present particularly interested:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The epic is a well defined unity.</li>
  <li>All the different parts of the poem are joined together with some distinct and definite purpose, and answering
    admirably that purpose.</li>
  <li>The unity of plan and aim was conceived in the mind of one single individual, who carried out the work in terms of
    this preconceived unity.</li>
  <li>Therefore successive expansion, and one or more recasts of the poem are out of the question.</li>
  <li>The date of the poem as composed or compiled by the diaskeuast is certainly <em>not</em> later than the
    fifth century B.C.</li>
</ol>
<p>With <strong>DAHLMANN</strong> the pendulum had clearly swung to the other extreme. We owe very impartial and
  searching criticisms of <strong>DAHLMANN</strong>'s views to <strong>JACOBI</strong> and <strong>BARTH</strong>, who
  have exposed certain weaknesses of the theory. Both <strong>JACOBI</strong> and <strong>BARTH</strong> admit the unity
  of aim and plan in the work, though both justly demur to the contention of <strong>DAHLMANN</strong> that the argument
  of the epic was invented merely for the purpose of illustrating maxims of law; nor were they of course inclined to
  accept the date proposed for the composition of the poem by the author of the Synthetic Theory.</p>

<p>We must also admit now that <strong>DAHLMANN</strong>'s views regarding the unity and homogeneity of the text of the
  epic were much exaggerated. It can now be demonstrated, with mathematical precision, that the text of the
  <em>Mahābhārata</em> used by <strong>DAHLMANN</strong> — the Bombay or Calcutta edition of the Vulgate — is much
  inflated with late accretions and most certainly does not, as a whole, go back to the fifth century B.C. It may even
  contain some furtive additions which had been made as late as 1000 A.D. or even later. The critical edition of the
  <em>Mahābhārata</em>, which is being published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, shows that large blocks
  of the text of the Vulgate must on incontrovertible evidence be excised as comparatively late interpolations. The
  Brahmā-Ganeśa complex and the Kaṇika Nīti in the Ādi and the hymns to Durgā in the Virāṭa and the Bhīṣma parvans occur
  to our mind readily as examples of such casual interpolations. But the Southern Recension offers us illustrations of
  regular long poems being bodily incorporated in the epic, like the detailed description of the avatāras of Viṣṇu put
  in the mouth of Bhīṣma in the Sabhā, and the full enunciation of the Vaiṣṇavadharma in the Āśvamedhikaparvan, two
  passages comprising together about 2500 stanzas. When we know that these additions have been made in comparatively
  recent times, even so late as the period to which our written tradition reaches back, can we legitimately assume that
  our text was free from such intrusions during that prolonged period in the history of our text which extends beyond
  the periphery of our manuscript tradition? In any case it is very evident that the text known to and used by
  <strong>DAHLMANN</strong> could not possibly go back in its entirety to the
</p>
fifth century B.C. That is all very true. Nevertheless it is well to bear in mind that however much the textual critic
might peel off from the external trappings of the Great Epic, its Gestalt remains absolutely unaltered.

<p><strong>DAHLMANN</strong> was profoundly impressed by the fact that the <em>Mahābhārata</em> was recognized
  throughout Indian antiquity, above all things, as a <em>dharma-saṃhitā</em>, as a <em>smṛti</em>. Witness the fact
  that the supposed hero of the epic, at least in its present form, is called Dharmarāja. He is the son of Dharma, in
  other words, Dharma incarnate (ātmā vai putranāmāsi). The Bhārata War was a dharma-yuddha. The field of battle itself
  was said to be a dharma-kṣetra (dharma-kṣetre Kurukṣetre). Victory, it is emphasized over and over again, is on the
  side of Dharma (yato dharmas tato jayah). Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa incarnates himself as Śrī Kṛṣṇa merely to restore the fallen
  Dharma: dharmasaṃsthāpanārthāya saṃbhavāmi yuge yuge. To <strong>DAHLMANN</strong> therefore the <em>Mahābhārata</em>
  appeared above all as a treatise on jurisprudence (dharmasāstra). And he naturally concluded that it was composed with
  the avowed and exclusive object of expounding all the different aspects of Hindu Law, in the widest sense of the term
  not omitting even its historical and archaic features and oddities.</p>

<p>But that is hardly plausible since such an explanation of the work obviously contradicts its character as a
  traditional book belonging to the people. The work was evidently meant to be a tome of genuine popular interest, one
  that should be read, studied and meditated on by all classes of the Indian people, not only by the learned Brāhmaṇas,
  Kṣatriyas, but also by Vaiśyas and Śūdras,—the fifth Veda (Pañcamo vedah), the new Veda of all people, irrespective of
  caste and creed. Now the man in the street, even in India, is definitely not interested in the intricacies of law,
  less still in the history and formulation of archaic and obsolete customs, as <strong>DAHLMANN</strong> was compelled
  to premise in view of the crucial example—as troublesome as ineradicable—of the polyandrous marriage of the princess
  of Pāñcāla. In a popular book, therefore,—as our epic claims to be—and has indeed proved to be—all those prolix
  argumentations on every conceivable topic could only be irrelevant, if we
  are to regard them merely as an ethnological retrospect or an historical commentary. <em>A priori</em> therefore we
  cannot accept DAHLMANN'S view as a sufficient explanation of the whole ideology of the <em>Mahābhārata</em>. There
  must be something more in the character of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> than a mere synthesis of all known aspects of law,
  even in its widest connotation of the Indian conception of Dharma.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that DAHLMANN had no explanation to offer of the paradox of Kṛṣṇa. Strangely enough—or perhaps
  quite characteristically—DAHLMANN entirely overlooked Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Kṛṣṇa who looms so large in the world of the epic
  poets as to overshadow the entire poem, who is to be found in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end of the
  entire epopee. With his eyes fixed on the dichotomy of Dharma and Adharma, the Jesuit Father missed completely the
  elusive Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the most characteristic creation of Indian genius, who was above Dharma and Adharma,
  beyond Good and Evil.</p>

<p>But we cannot afford to ignore Śrī Kṛṣṇa if we would understand aright the meaning of the <em>Mahābhārata</em>.
  DAHLMANN succeeded in understanding only Yudhiṣṭhira, the Dharmarāja. But Yudhiṣṭhira is, metaphorically speaking,
  merely the big tree of Dharma (dharmamayo mahādrumaḥ), the straight upright trunk with its expanse of foliage and
  branches, fruits and flowers, the thing one sees growing out of the soil on the surface of the earth. The root of this
  tree is elsewhere:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mūlam Kṛṣṇo Brahma ca brāhmaṇāś ca / 1. 1. 66.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The root, hidden deep in the soil, is Kṛṣṇa and the inscrutable Brahma and the knowers of Brahma.</p>

<p>Well might OLDENBERG ask: "Wer ist Kṛṣṇa?" Who is Kṛṣṇa, indeed? That paradox of paradoxes! A philosopher on the
  battlefield! An ally who gives away his powerful army to swell the ranks of his opponents; and himself, though the
  omnipotent lord of all weapons, takes a vow, before the commencement of the war, not to hold a weapon in his hands! A
  god who avows impartiality towards all living beings, and yet like a wily and unscrupulous politician secretly plots
  for the victory of the Pāṇḍavas and the annihilation of the Kauravas! Standing on the field of battle, this
  self-styled Avatāra preaches
  the lower morality and the Mere Man (Arjuna) the higher! A grotesque character who claims to be the highest god and
  behaves uncommonly like a "tricky mortal"!</p>

<p>This bizarre figure can certainly not belong to the original heroic poem, which must have been a straightforward work
  free from all contradictions of this kind. European savants are agreed that he must needs be an innovation, introduced
  secondarily into the original "epic nucleus." How could European savants, lacking as they do in their intellectual
  make-up the millenniums old background of Indian culture, ever hope to penetrate this inscrutable mask of the
  Unknowable pulling faces at them, befooling them and enjoying their antics? However we shall leave the matter there
  for the present.</p>

<p>There is just one further point that I would lightly touch upon before I close this all too brief a survey of the
  modern criticism of our Great Epic, namely, the question of the historicity of the work. Opinion is sharply divided on
  this point. The work claims itself to be an Itihāsa, a history; but criticism, both ancient and modern, has been loth
  to take this statement at its face value. Opinion has thus vacillated from the standpoint of categorical acceptance of
  perfect historicity to complete scepticism.</p>

<p>It was mentioned above that <strong>DAHLMANN</strong> had denied historical reality to the fable and toyed with the
  idea of symbolism. The polyandrous marriage especially, according to <strong>DAHLMANN</strong>, was but a symbol of
  the perfect unity of the Hindu joint family. The battle as depicted in the epic took place only in the imagination of
  the poet.</p>

<p>Before him, the Vedist <strong>LUDWIG</strong>, not finding any support for the story in the Vedic antiquity, had
  also tried to give a symbolic interpretation on the basis of a nature myth. In the seasonal myth of
  <strong>LUDWIG</strong>, the Pāṇḍavas symbolize the seasons; and Draupadi, their common spouse, is the dark earth
  possessed alternately by the five seasons. In time these "seasons" lose their wealth and hoarded gold (i.e. their
  lustre, splendour) in the fatal game of dice with the base Duryodhana, until at last their common wife, Kṛṣṇa, is left
  in possession of only a single garment (the earth becomes "bare," denuded, in winter). All
  this may be granted, for the sake of argument. But we fail to understand why any one should trouble to write about a
  seasonal myth in the form of a poem comprising 100,000 stanzas. Nor can <strong>LUDWIG</strong> explain the mystery:
  "warum und wodurch veranlaszt ein dichter auf diesen gedanken kam, wird natürlich immer ein rätsel bleiben." We may
  take it that <strong>LUDWIG</strong> has not been able to solve the riddle propounded by himself; and we would be wise
  not to bother ourselves with it further.</p>

<p>Even before <strong>LUDWIG</strong>, <strong>LASSEN</strong> had tried his hand at giving a symbolical explanation of
  the story, which has not appealed to other scholars. The <em>dramatis personae</em> of the epic were not ordinary
  human beings; they are to be understood rather as historical conditions or circumstances. Pāṇḍu (literally, pale,
  white) was not a person, but was originally the name of a royal family of the "White race," which had migrated into
  India from the north and which was later known in Sanskrit as Arjuna (literally, white). Pāṇḍu would thus represent
  the most ancient period of the history of the family and Arjuna the later. His name would accordingly belong to the
  order of other similar names: Śūra, Vasudeva, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇā, which represent not persons but circumstances and events.
  Passages were cited by <strong>LASSEN</strong> to show that Arjuna is the real representative of the other brothers.
  The name of his wife Subhadrā ("the harbinger of good fortune") is a happy expression for the close connection of the
  Pāṇḍavas with the people of Kṛṣṇa and of the descent of the later Pāṇḍava kings from a queen belonging to the family
  of the Yādavas.</p>

<p>A very novel interpretation of the epic we owe to Principal <strong>THADANI</strong>, Professor of English in the
  Hindu College of Delhi, embodied in an ambitious work comprising five volumes entitled <em>The Mystery of the
    Mahābhārata</em>: a difficult book which no layman can hope to understand. Professor <strong>THADANI</strong> is a
  philosopher and a poet. Accordingly his great work is both poetical and philosophical. It deepens and intensifies the
  "mystery" of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> rather than solves it. As a matter of fact I do not think that there is any real
  mystery in the <em>Mahābhārata</em> to solve. One has only to read the epic with a mind free from prepossessions, and
  the "mystery" dissolves of itself. However let us hear Professor THADANI himself. The whole story of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> is,
  according to this learned scholar, "but an account of the connection and conflict between the different systems of
  Hindu Philosophy and Religion." This is especially so in regard to the principal systems. Thus there is a conflict
  between principal Vedānta (Vaiṣṇavism) and principal Yoga (Śaivism); principal Yoga and principal Sāṃkhya (Buddhism
  and Jainism); principal Sāṃkhya and Principal Vedānta. This you will see is a perfect cycle of eternal conflicts! I
  give the next step in the argument in Professor THADANI's own words, lest I should unwittingly misrepresent his views.
  In all these cases, says the learned Professor, "there is a common ground of agreement between the opposing systems,
  without which no discussion can ever take place. And it is this that corresponds to a 'battle-field' in the language
  of war; for all debate may be likened to a combat, where each side, starting from some common point of agreement,
  marshals its array of arguments. All these points of view of the different systems of thought are examined in the
  <em>Mahābhārata</em> in story-form. Of these the most interesting as well as the most comprehensive conflict is
  between principal Vedanta and principal Sankhya, or Vaishnavism on the one hand and Buddhism and Jainism on the other,
  — and that is the subject-matter of the great 'battle' of Kurukṣhetra."
</p>

<p>In another place, Professor THADANI makes his meaning still clearer. The Great Epic is not a mere story of the deeds
  of mythological or historical gods or heroes; but "a wonderful explanation of all systems of Hindu Philosophy and
  Religion... which, when examined in the light of ancient method of Letter-analysis, reveals the great secret of its
  real meaning and mystery." Kṛṣṇa, according to this method of interpretation, represents Vedānta-Yoga-Vaiśeṣika. Droṇa
  as a teacher of Buddhism represents Vaiśeṣika-Nyāya. Draupadī is the sacrifice of the Mind and the senses and their
  objects, leading to God. This "letter-analysis" is a real magic wand in the hands of Professor THADANI. With the help
  of this mysterious instrument, the learned Professor gets the most astounding results. People have so long considered
  the Gambling Match as the most realistic and heart-rending scene of the whole <em>Mahābhārata</em>, and some soft-hearted people must have even shed surreptitiously a few tears when reading the
  pathetic scene of the denudation of the noble Princess of Pāñcāla by the vicious Duḥśāsana. Professor THADANI brushes
  away all this shallow and misplaced sentimentality. "The word for gambling in the text," argues Professor THADANI, "is
  Dyūta (d, y, u, ta) meaning, (d) giving, (y) Buddhi, (u) woven with (u) the senses of knowledge, and (ta) the senses
  of Action. The Gambling Match is thus a discussion between Buddhi on the one hand (Yudhishthira), and the senses of
  Knowledge and Action, the basis of Jainism (Śakuni) on the other." A foreign critic has ungenerously remarked about
  the book that it is confusion worse confounded. I will not criticize this theory. Professor THADANI is right in
  insisting that for debate or discussion there must be a common ground of agreement between opposing views, without
  which a discussion is impossible. I have none with the learned Professor, nor have I had the good fortune of coming
  across anybody who had. Professor THADANI stands unchallenged.</p>

<p>I have mentioned these attempts at symbolical or allegorical interpretation of the <em>Mahābhārata</em> specially
  with a view to showing that writers starting from the most varied hypotheses and holding the most divergent views
  regarding the character and origin of the Great Epic of India have refused to see in it a plain and straightforward
  narrative, an unvarnished statement of facts, in short, a factitive history. They have endeavoured to look behind or
  beyond the facts narrated and see in the narrative some other purpose. Thus far they are certainly right. That
  different critics have given different interpretations of the same set of facts is in my opinion no reason for
  discrediting these efforts and for supposing that no such interpretations is possible. For one thing, the efforts
  mentioned above have been quite arbitrary, being supported by very flimsy arguments, without a basis either in the
  work itself or in the Indian tradition. The only thing that can be said about them is that they form undoubtedly a
  move in the right direction. For indeed many, if not most, great works of art and literature are filled with some sort
  of symbolism. I shall return to this question in the sequel.</p>
<p>Let us however in the meantime look at the matter from yet another angle. Is it not passing strange that,
  notwithstanding the repeated and dogged attempts of Western savants to demonstrate that our <em>Mahābhārata</em> is
  but an unintelligible conglomerate of disjointed pieces, without any meaning as a whole, the epic should always have
  occupied in Indian antiquity an eminent position and uniformly enjoyed the highest reputation? It was used, we are
  told, as a book of education for the young Bāṇa's time, like the <em>Iliad</em> in Hellenic Greece. It has inspired
  the poets and dramatists of India as a quarry for their plots and ideas. It has attracted in the past celebrated
  Indian philosophers like Ācārya Saṁkara and Kumārila, famous Indian saints like Jnaneshwar and Ramdas, and
  distinguished Indian rulers like Akbar and Shivaji. This Epic of the Bhāratas had moreover penetrated to the farthest
  extremities of Greater India. It had conquered not only Burma and Siam, but even the distant islands of Java and Bali.
  The immortal stories of this epic have been carved on the walls of the temples of these people by their sculptors,
  painted on their canvasses by their artists, acted in their wayongs by their showmen.</p>

<p>What is more remarkable still is that this epic — along with the <em>Rāmāyaṇa</em> — is still living and throbbing in
  the lives of the Indian people, — not merely of the intelligentsia, but also of the illiterate and inarticulate
  masses, the "hewers of wood and the carriers of water." To such as these, as one foreign observer has pertinently
  observed, "the famous old stories are the music and colour of life. They are the perennial fount from which the
  oft-repeated draughts never quench and insatiable thirst." The grand legends of the Great War are even now recited and
  expounded in kings' palaces and in peasants' huts to an enraptured audience.</p>

<p>What is the secret of this book of which India feels after nearly two thousand years that she has not yet had enough?
  It would be a rather hazardous conjecture to suppose that such a thing might perchance happen also to the works of the
  critics of the <em>Mahābhārata</em>, for within less than half a century the lucubrations of these wiseacres have
  approached perilously near the limbo of oblivion, from which they are periodically snatched
out by the industrious pedagogue and the curious antiquarian, eager to extend his knowledge of the history of
literature. The epic obviously contains something — some elusive ideal — that produces this permanent and not transient
quality of interest. Even Oldenberg, who had pronounced the epic to be a chaos, felt — and rightly — that "in the
<em>Mahābhārata</em> breathe the united soul of India and the individual souls of her people." It is a high claim, and
yet the <em>Mahābhārata</em> may be said to be more, even than that.</p>

<p>Modern scientists are interested in breaking the Atom, which we are told is a solar system in miniature, in order to
  release the captive energy for the exploitation of Nature. The Rishis of ancient India were interested
  in breaking the tangled knot of personality, which is the very cosmos in miniature, in order to release the captive
  energy for the sublimation of Nature. The titanic painters of the colossal <em>Mahābhārata</em> canvass were all
  imbued with this idea, urged from within by this need, for they were the proud inheritors of that esoteric culture
  which made it possible to realize that ideal. Unseen but all pervasive in the life of every people is the great
  company of its ideals. And the <em>Mahābhārata</em> is the Golden Treasury of the Ideals of the Indians at their best.
  It is this fact which had attracted in the past the great philosophers, the great saints and the great rulers of India
  to the <em>Mahābhārata</em>. And we have not outlived that mighty book yet. On the contrary, we have yet to learn the
  lesson taught by that great book, that book of books, which offers to each what he needs and what he can digest.</p>

<p>How shall we then set about studying this great poem?</p>

<p>Higher Criticism would have us search for the lost "epic nucleus," which is apparently something immensely worth
  possessing. With that end in view it proceeds by the method of athetizing certain lines, passages, chapters, or even
  whole books. These are spurious, and all the rest is the work of one great poet. This method has been applied to
  comparatively more recent and also much simpler works, about whose historical context we happen to be better informed
  and where it would be much more legitimate. Yet even in these cases it
  has, as is well known, completely broken down. Very little reflection is needed to convince one that a mere process of
  stripping off what we regard as spurious will not automatically leave us with the pure and unalloyed "original." As we
  analyse the poem back towards its source, it proves to have not one source but many. What shall we do then? We know
  nothing about the hypothetical "nucleus." Moreover the nucleus we may discover in our analytical adventures is likely
  to prove to be not the "original" we are looking for, but merely a projection of our own feelings. On the other hand
  we have got the poem, about which there is no doubt, and we may be able to puzzle out a good deal about its meaning,
  its inner meaning, if we tried. Let us then focus our thoughts upon that and try to understand it as best as we can. I
  believe we shall find in the poem itself something far greater and nobler than the lost paradise of the primitive
  Kṣatriya tale of love and war, for which the Western savants have been vainly searching and which the Indian people
  had long outgrown and discarded. </p>
