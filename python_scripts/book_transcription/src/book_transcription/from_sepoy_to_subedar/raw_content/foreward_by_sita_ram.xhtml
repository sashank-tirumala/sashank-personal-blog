<h1><em>Foreword by Sita Ram</em></h1>
<h2>FROM SEPOY TO SUBEDAR</h2>
<h3><em>Being the Autobiography of a Sepoy</em></h3>

<p><em>Defender of the poor!—obedience, etc., etc.—</em>I have, by the fatherly kindness of the Government, been granted
    my pension, and according to your desire, I now send your Lordship, by the hands of my son, the papers containing
    all I can remember of my life during the forty-eight years I have been in the service of the English Nation in which
    I have suffered seven severe wounds, and received six medals, which I am proud to wear. I trust what I have now
    written, and what I have before at different times related to your Honour, may prove that there were some who
    remained faithful, and were not affected by the Wind of Madness which lately blew over Hindustan; for my belief is,
    it was this which blighted the army. My Lord knows I am not much of a Munshi, although I have been taught Persian;
    therefore my language must be excused. And without doubt, I have forgotten the English years in some instances; but
    what I have related to you, and what I have here written, it is true. To say more would be overstepping the bounds
    of propriety.</p>

<p>May prosperity ever attend your footsteps!<br />
    Your slave,</p>
